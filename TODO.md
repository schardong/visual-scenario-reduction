# TO-DO list
* Do not allow for deactivating both lines and points in the projection chart;
* Add a dummy plot of the baseline percentile to the bump and distance charts (on the X axis itself);
* Move the fan chart to the top left position of the layout;
  * Change the plot's background color to indicate that it is not interactible.

## Research
* Figure out the 3 timesteps that the distance plot fails to deliver the correct result;
* Test the method in CMOST and compare the results (which software is cheaper, more acessible, error metrics, etc.).
